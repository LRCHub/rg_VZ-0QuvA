How much I wished for another
Better happier brighter future
Here I am at the gate I stand
Dear old times
I've made up my mind
How much you must
have suffered through my anger
have overlooked your wonder
Vulgar awkward composure
Forward sincere manners
Here we are at the fated land
I shall make it end
Will you watch me end?
Oh
Round and round we go
Holding on to pain
Driven by our egos
Feelings untold
Spinning our own versions
of the past
That you could never know
Cause I know
I must be the reason why
You have given up your smiles
And the hope inside your eyes
have been stolen
I must be the reason why
You must tell me all these lies
Wishing you a better life
without me by your side
The message has already been said
through patches of violet
How much we must have diverged
Hello
Goodnight
Goodbye
Hello
Goodnight
I'm here
Goodbye
Waiting
Here we are,
it's our final chance
With your hand
Do what must be done

Oh
Round and round we go
Holding on to pain
Driven by our egos
Feelings untold
Spinning our own versions
of the past
That you could never know
How would I know?
I could be the reason why
You were able to be kind
And the hearts we held so tight
won't stay broken
Love must be the reason why
I still believe in this lie
That you'll live a better life
without me by your side
The message has already been said
